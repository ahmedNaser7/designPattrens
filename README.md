## 📝 Quick Guide for Junior Developers
Below is a table to help junior developers understand the purpose of each design pattern:

| Pattern | Type | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| Singleton | Creational | Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global access point. |
| Factory Method | Creational | Creates objects without specifying their concrete classes. |
| Abstract Factory | Creational | Provides an interface for creating related objects without specifying their concrete classes. |
| Builder | Creational | Constructs complex objects step by step. |
| Prototype | Creational | Creates new objects by copying an existing object. |
| Adapter | Structural | Allows incompatible interfaces to work together. |
| Bridge | Structural | Separates abstraction from implementation. |
| Composite | Structural | Treats individual objects and compositions uniformly. |
| Decorator | Structural | Adds responsibilities to objects dynamically. |
| Facade | Structural | Provides a simplified interface to a complex system. |
| Flyweight | Structural | Reduces memory usage by sharing common object states. |
| Proxy | Structural | Controls access to another object. |
| Chain of Responsibility | Behavioral | Passes requests along a chain of handlers. |
| Command | Behavioral | Encapsulates a request as an object. |
| Interpreter | Behavioral | Implements a grammar interpreter. |
| Iterator | Behavioral | Provides a way to access elements sequentially without exposing the underlying structure. |
| Mediator | Behavioral | Reduces direct dependencies between components. |
| Memento | Behavioral | Captures and restores an object's internal state. |
| Observer | Behavioral | Defines a dependency between objects so that when one changes, all are notified. |
| State | Behavioral | Allows an object to alter its behavior when its state changes. |
| Strategy | Behavioral | Defines a family of algorithms and makes them interchangeable. |
| Template Method | Behavioral | Defines the program skeleton in a base class but lets subclasses alter steps. |
| Visitor | Behavioral | Adds new operations to existing object structures without modifying them. |
